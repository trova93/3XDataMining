# 3X Data Mining

3X Data Mining is a data mining project created by 6 students completing their Masters in Data Science at the Bologna Business School

> The topic for 3X is Employee attrition. 
>The data has been taken from [IBM Employee HR Attrition Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) 
 > The main Business problem that is being solved here is how can a system be created to help big companies control their attrition by understanding which employee could leave so as to provide him/her some incentives to stay back.
